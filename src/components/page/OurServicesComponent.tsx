                            <p>The different legal systems, as well as cultural, social, historical and religious particularities, make each country of ASEAN a different market. They must be part of a long-term strategy with a focus on relationship management. Asian importers place much more value on person relationships than managers in Western countries. In a business situation, Asian managers will place a great deal of emphasis on knowing one's counterpart before entering into an agreement, as part of a risk reduction strategy. If they do not like you, they will not buy from you.
                            </p>

                            <p> We help you to build relationships that will lead to a lasting beneficial business partnership. We expand your market and build your image in ASEAN by targeting the most relevant importers to develop your sales through the right distribution channels. We monitor trends, competition and provide strategic information on local markets. We offer you visibility and protect your interests and your brand image.</p>

                            <p> We help you to source the worldâ€™s greatest, and sometimes hardest to acquire, fine wines.
In Asia the prevalence of fake bottles is rising and provenance should be the key factor for fine wine collectors. That's why we are only working with Chateaux/Domains and reputable wine merchants who can guaranty the origin of the wine.

                            <p>1). Ex-Chateau/Domain, the wine comes directly from the cellar of the producer.</p>
                            <p>2). Well established wine merchant who can prove that the wine has never been stored elsewhere than at the Chateau/Domain's cellar and at the wine merchant's warehouse.</p>
